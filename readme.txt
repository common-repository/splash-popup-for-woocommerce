= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =
If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that your plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!
